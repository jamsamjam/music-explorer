## ðŸŽ§ Try It Yourself

Want to try a similar analysis on another piece?  
To launch the interactive analysis interface, make sure you've installed the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run main.py
```

This will open a browser window where you can upload a `.wav` file and view the full audio feature analysis. This framework works especially well for music with clear builds, minimalism, or evolving textures.

Happy listening and analyzing!
